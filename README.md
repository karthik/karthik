# :wave:  Hi, I'm Karthik 👨🏽‍💻️

 I'm a research associate professor at UC Berkeley's [Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu/). I'm passionate about making science more open and research software more visible. I lead [The rOpenSci project](https://github.com/ropensci), [The US Research Software Sustainability Institute](https://github.com/si2-urssi) and edit for [The Journal of Open Source](https://joss.theoj.org/) and [ReScience](http://rescience.github.io/) among others.
