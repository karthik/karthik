I am a research associate professor at UC Berkeley's Institute for Data Science. I'm passionate about making science more open and research software more visible. In 2011, I co-founded the rOpenSci project and served as its founding director through 2014. I am an advisor for The US Research Software Sustainability Institute, The UK Software Sustainability Institute (SSI), and an advisor to Open Journals. Lately, you can find me on <a rel="me" href="https://bsky.app/profile/karthik.io">BlueSky</a>.
